            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Fox Valley Freight was founded by <strong>Austin (Kayleigh)</strong>, whose passion for all things 
                <em>big rig</em> began at an early age. Ever since the age of five, Austin has been fascinated by the 
                power, design, and purpose of trucks—and alongside that came a lifelong love of gaming. 
                Those two passions came together in <strong>American Truck Simulator</strong>, where trucking realism 
                meets the excitement of an expansive virtual world.
            </p>

            <p>
                The creation of Fox Valley Freight came from a simple vision: to build a virtual trucking company 
                where drivers could experience both the fun and the responsibility of the open road. 
                Austin recognized that ATS was more than just a game—it was a chance to bring people together, 
                to share stories, to push limits, and to create a sense of community in the world of 
                simulation trucking.
            </p>

            <p>
                What makes Fox Valley Freight unique is not just our dedication to realism, but also the family-like 
                environment we strive to provide. Whether you’re a seasoned virtual driver with countless miles 
                logged, or someone just starting out on their very first haul, we believe everyone has a place here. 
                Our company values <strong>teamwork, professionalism, and respect</strong>—and we extend those values 
                into everything we do.
            </p>

            <p>
                American Truck Simulator was chosen as our home because it mirrors the freedom of trucking while 
                giving us the tools to build something larger than ourselves. Every delivery is more than just freight 
                on the road—it’s a shared journey, a story told mile by mile. We embrace ATS because it reflects 
                both the real challenges of trucking and the rewarding satisfaction of reaching each destination.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, Fox Valley Freight stands as more than just a virtual trucking company—it’s a community, 
                a family, and a home for passionate drivers from all walks of life. Our goal is to keep expanding, 
                to bring new opportunities for our drivers, and to continue shaping a future where 
                <em>gaming meets trucking, and passion meets purpose.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                No matter where the road leads, Fox Valley Freight is here to keep on trucking—together.
